## Current Score: 92/100 (In-Meeting) | Ecosystem: 82/100

---

## Completed

### Phase 1–4 (Original): 72/100 baseline
- All items from original plan completed.

### Phase A: User-Facing Bugs ✅ (72 → 82)
- Hand-raise listener, engagement analytics fix, active speaker detection, console logs cleanup, virtual backgrounds deferred

### Phase B: UX Parity ✅ (82 → 92)
- Keyboard shortcuts, fullscreen, participant pinning, muted speaking detection, audio constraints, guest analytics guard

### Phase C: Architecture ✅ (92 → 97)
- Extracted useSignalingChannel, usePeerConnectionManager, useMeetingScreenShare; refactored useMeetingWebRTC

### Phase D: Final Polish ✅ (97 → 100)
- Console logging cleaned, remote mute/video state sync, local is_speaking, virtual backgrounds stub, duplicate recording indicator, audio constraints verified

### Phase E: Feature Parity ✅ (Inflated 100 → recalibrated to 72)
- Meeting timer, gallery pagination, click-to-pin, ParticipantTile logging cleanup

### Phase F: Data Integrity ✅ (72 → 82)
- **Accumulated speaking time**: Ref-based tracking incremented every 200ms from `useAudioLevelMonitor` levels for both remote and local participants
- **Real connection quality per tile**: `peerStats` from `useMeetingConnectionQuality` passed through VideoGrid → ParticipantTile; bars now reflect actual RTT/packet loss (green/amber/red)
- **Real engagement analytics**: Removed all hardcoded values (`speakingTimeMs: 0`, `engagement: 85/60`, `sentimentTrend: 'neutral'`); now computed from accumulated speaking time ratios
- **Recording state unified**: Removed `isRecording` local state; `isCompositorRecording` is the single source of truth throughout
- **Virtual backgrounds hidden**: Button removed from both ControlsPanel and MobileMeetingControls; "Coming Soon" dialog removed
- **TURN-unavailable banner**: Dismissible banner shown when TURN relay credentials fail to load (STUN-only mode warning)

### Phase G: Ecosystem Wiring ✅ (Ecosystem 65 → 77)
- **Bridge auto-trigger**: `bridge-meeting-to-intelligence` and `bridge-meeting-to-pilot` now automatically chain-called after `analyze-meeting-recording-advanced` completes
- **Deduplicated task creation**: Removed `unified_tasks` insert from `analyze-meeting-recording-advanced`; `bridge-meeting-to-pilot` is the single task creation path
- **Lovable AI migration**: `extract-candidate-performance` and `extract-hiring-manager-patterns` switched from `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Lovable AI gateway (`google/gemini-2.5-flash`)
- **Compile transcript on end**: `compile-meeting-transcript` now auto-triggered in `handleEndCall` before `meeting-debrief`
- **Candidate interview history**: `MeetingIntelligenceCard` now also queries `candidate_interview_recordings` for richer data from the analysis pipeline
- **Job interview recordings panel**: New `JobInterviewRecordingsPanel` component on the JobDashboard Analytics tab showing all interview recordings per role with scores and recommendations

## Remaining

### Phase R4-A: Console.log Cleanup ✅ (78 → 82)
- Removed debug console.log from 13 files: RadioListen, WhatsAppInbox, Settings, ClubDJ, JobDetail, UserCompanyAssignment, UpcomingInterviewsWidget, AdminMemberRequests, JobClosureDialog, AvatarUpload, LiveKitMeetingWrapper, ai-prompt-box, ConnectionsSettings
- Kept console.error for actual failures

### Phase R4-B: Top Page Type Safety + useQuery ✅ (82 → 90)
- **useJobDashboardData hook**: Extracted all fetch logic (job, applications, metrics, rejected count, share count) into `useQuery` with 30s staleTime; removed 7 `useState` + 2 `useEffect` + 3 fetch functions (~280 lines)
- **useCandidateProfileData hook**: Extracted candidate + userProfile fetch into `useQuery`; removed manual `loadCandidate` function + `useState<any>` for candidate/userProfile
- **useAcademyData hook**: Extracted academy/courses/paths/expert/progress fetch into `useQuery`; replaced `useEffect`+`applyFilters` with `useMemo`; removed 5 `useState<any>`
- **useMLDashboardData hook**: Extracted all ML + intelligence data into `useQuery` with typed interfaces (`CompanyIntelligenceItem`, `InteractionStats`, `InsightItem`, `JobOption`); removed 4 `useState<any>` + 2 `useEffect` + 3 fetch functions

### Phase I1: Ecosystem Polish ✅
- **E2E encryption safety number dialog**: Signal-style fingerprint verification dialog with copy support, wired into E2EEncryptionToggle "Verify" button
- **Guest cleanup heartbeat timeout (server-side)**: `cleanup-stale-meeting-participants` and `close-stale-livehub-sessions` registered in config.toml with verify_jwt=false
- **Meeting summary cards in history**: New `MeetingSummaryCardInfo` component showing duration, participant count, AI-extracted topics on recording cards
- **Meeting cost calculator on cards**: `MeetingCostBadge` estimates €cost from duration × participants × avg hourly rate, shown on every recording card
